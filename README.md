# Deep-Audio-Classifier

# Motivation
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model to automate the identification and counting of Capuchinbird calls based on the input audio clips. 
By leveraging advanced audio signal processing techniques, we seek to create a reliable and efficient tool for researchers and conservationists.
